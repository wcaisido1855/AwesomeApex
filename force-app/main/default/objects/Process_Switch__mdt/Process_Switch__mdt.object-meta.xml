    <description>The Process Switch is a custom Metadata Type used as a check control whether Apex Triggers, Validation Rules, or Flows are allowed to Run. 

Extend as needed for other types of Processes / Automations

When building, always include the master {&quot;All&quot; Switch } and the Switch for the specific Hierarchy. 
EX: When building the Account Trigger, include {&quot;All Apex Trigger Switches&quot;} &amp;&amp; {&quot;Trigger Switch: Account&quot;}, check that the related Process Switch is either: {Enabled} or {not Disabled}.

Change Process Switches to {&quot;Disabled&quot;} when performing Data Loads to increse performance</description>
